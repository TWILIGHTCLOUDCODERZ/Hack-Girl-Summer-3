<li>**Github:-**</li>
&emsp;&emsp;The site has been hosted in Github which includes project repository-[WebviewLink](https://twilightcloudcoderz.github.io/Hack-Girl-Summer-3/).

## What it does

&emsp;&emsp;Raptorz Healthcare AI-BOT helps to book appointment without service desk interaction and Powerbi data visualization helps to understand the participants data to their field of  study and interests.

###More in detail about application,

<li>**AI-BOT :-**</li>
 &emsp;&emsp;AI-BOT helps user to book medical appointment according to doctor availability timing for health measurements which solves service desk burden and helps hospital to understand the detailed data via stored procedure insights which helps for solving future appointment measurements. 

&emsp;&emsp; Patient data is visualized which analyze and explore data of vaccination details according to age and country wise.

## How we built it

<p>Involves 6 steps:-</p>
Application is built using java,html,css3,and data stored in shared point.

<li>**Twilio:-**</li>
 &emsp;&emsp; Via Twilio API post call integrated with Microsoft power automate send appointment booking details to user as a confirmation and reminder notification.

<li>**webview:-**</li>
 &emsp;&emsp; Built using Html,css3,java,json,bootstrap, hosted in Github.

<li>**Backend:-**</li>
 &emsp;&emsp;Once the form is submitted data stored in share point with help of powerflow.

<li>**Powerflow:-**</li>
 &emsp;&emsp;Send email communication appointment booking confirmation and event pass for environment planting.

<li>**PowerBi:-**</li>

<li>**Powervirtual Agent :-**</li>
&emsp;&emsp;Respond rapidly to your user and employee needs—at scale—using intelligent conversational.

## Challenges

&emsp;&emsp;Integrating Twilio with Powerflow but solved by researching through youtube videos and docs available through community forums.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

&emsp;&emsp;Learn't about AI feature and Data Analytics.

## What's next for HEALTH CARE BOT AND DATA ANALYTICS
Need to explore more about Twilio and integration with other platforms like cloud service Azure, Aws.
